# ðŸ”Ž EverythingSearchClient TestProject
Note: this test project is not to do an exhaustive test of Everything itself.
It's only purpose is to the whether or not the features of the EverythingSearchClient's interface show the expected effects.
It is also not meant to be complete, e.g. in terms of test-driven development.
Consider this project a smoke test, doing a rough check of fitness only.
